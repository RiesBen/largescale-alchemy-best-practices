# Best Practices for Large-Scale Alchemical Free Energy Simulations

The original best practices guide will be split into two documents: the first will gives best practices for running a **single** calculation (and give details on theory/ system-specific setup), while the second will give best practices for running **multiple** calculations (with a focus on automation). The first will become version 2.0 of the current guide, while the second will be submitted as a new manuscript.

This document outlines the contents of the second document for multiple calculations. This will also have a focus on methods for automation.
